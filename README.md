# Description
This is a memory allocator with a runtime complexity of `O(log N)`.
## How works?
Basically I move the brk address or break address 8 kilo bytes upper, using the `sys_brk` call, to create an array where I use it to create heap, with that implementation I accomplish a runtime of `o(logn)` when `free` function gets executed.

And when ges execute `alloc` checks if there is a chuck with enough memory to use it, so if there is well it is going to take that chuck divided into two new chucks and return the chuck with the memory that you need and the another one will be pushed into the heap, doing a runtime again of `O(logn)`.
## How to use it?
To use it you only need to put this lines of code inside of your `.c` code, like this.
```
extern void *alloc(unsigned amount_bytes);
extern void afree(void *addr);
```
Then just compile it with the `alloc.o` file, and to compile it with your code you only need to use the flag `-no-pie`, because the `alloc.o` it is not an pie object, then for example.
```
$ clang -no-pie alloc.o main.c -o main.out
```
## How to compile it?
To compiled and generate the `alloc.o` just run, and you wil have it for any project.
```
$ make
```
